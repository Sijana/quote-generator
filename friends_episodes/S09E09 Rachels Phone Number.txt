Directed by: Ben Weiss


[Scene: Chandler's office in Tulsa.�� His assistant is showing him photographs.]

Jo Lynn: This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.

Chandler: Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?

(Phone rings.� Chandler answers using the speaker phone.)

Chandler: Chandler Bing.

Joey: Hey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant?

(She frowns.� Chandler picks up the hand set.)

Chandler: What's up Joe?

Joey: Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?

Chandler: Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?

Joey: No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!

Chandler: Courtside?� Oh my God.

Joey: Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.

Chandler: That's so cool.� I'll let Monica know.

(Chandler hangs up and calls Monica who is reading a book on their sofa as the phone rings.)

Monica: Hello?

Chandler: Joey just called.� He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.

Monica: Really?� But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.� If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.

Chandler: But hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . (Pause)� That's not the way to convince you.

Monica: Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game.� You have to spend time with me."� So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .

Chandler: I know.� You're right.� I want to see you too.� I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He's really looking forward to this.

Monica: Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.� Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� Tell him that what little time we have is precious.

Chandler: Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I'll think of something.

Rachel: Oh well, well thank you.� (She laughs.� He stares for a moment.)� Okay, stop.� Stop looking at me like that.� The last time that happened, (points to Ross) that happened.� (points to Emma.)

Ross: Oh right, right.� (They pause and exchange a glance. Then, Ross looks away.)� So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?

Rachel: Yeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.

Ross: Oh, it's fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.

Rachel: Phoebe's Mike?

Ross: Yeah.

Rachel: I didn't know you guys hung out.

Ross: We don't.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.

Rachel: Oh that's so cute:� Ross and Mike's first date.� Is that going to be awkward?� I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?

Ross: I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.

(Rachel nods.� There is a knock on the door.)

Rachel: Yeah.

(Phoebe and Mike enter.)

Phoebe: Hi

Rachel: Hey.

Phoebe: (spotting Rachel's dress) Oooh.� Girl's night out indeed.

Ross: Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.

Rachel: Okay.� You too.� And I hope you score.� (to Mike) Bye.

Mike: Bye.

Ross: So . . .� Welcome.

Mike: (Holds up a six pack of Foster's Lager) I got beer.

Ross: I got bottled breast milk.

Mike: Eh, why don't we start with the beer?

Ross: Okay.� (They sit.)� So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.

Mike: Yeah.

Ross: You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.

Mike: Ah?� (pause)� Do you have one here?

Ross: No.

Mike: Okay.� (pause)

(They clink beer bottles, and drink.� Then, they stare uncomfortably at their bottles.)

Ross: Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?

Mike: Yeah.� (pause)� Yeah, I'm sorry.� I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.

Ross: (pause) That's okay.� We'll talk about (pause) something else.� (They pause.� They drink.)

Mike:� So, you're a paleontologist, right?

Ross: Yeah.

Mike: My cousin's a paleontologist.

Ross: Ah?� (Mike nods.� Another pause.)� Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.

[Scene:� Monica and Chandler's apartment.� Monica is wearing a sexy negligee.� She pours two glasses of wine as Chandler enters with a carry-on suitcase.� He sets the case by the door.)

Monica: Hi.

Chandler: Hey.

Monica: Welcome home.

Chandler: (Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to Monica.)� Oh well, look at you.

Monica: Yeah.� What do you think?

Chandler: Well, it looks great.� It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.� So . . .

Monica: Oh.

Chandler: See what I mean . . . (They kiss.)

(There is a loud thud at the door.)

Joey: Hey!� How come the door's locked?

Monica: Just a second.

Chandler: (hushed) No, no, no, no, no.� Joey can't know that I'm here.

Monica: Why not?

Chandler: Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.

Monica: So, you lied to him?

Chandler: Achhh.� It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.� (pause)� Except with you.

Joey: Hey!� Open the door.� What's going on?� (He knocks.)

(Monica goes to the door.� Chandler slides behind it as she opens it slightly.)

Joey: What are you . ..� (He sees her in her negligee.)� Why are you dressed like that?

Monica: Oh, because, um . . .� well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days.� So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.

Joey: Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.

Monica: Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.� You know, like, "Hi, How do I look?"� (As Chandler) "Really sexy.� Could I Be any more turned on?"

Joey: Okay.� (pause.� He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.)� Whoa, whoa.� Why are there two glasses of wine out?

Monica: Because. . .� one of them is for you.

(Monica turns to get the wine.� Chandler peeps through the peephole.� Joey, seeing something, peeps back.� Chandler ducks.� Monica returns with two glasses of wine.� She gives one to Joey.)

Monica: Cheers.� (She clinks his glass and pulls back.)� Okay, buh-bye.� (She closes the door.)

Chandler: You know, it's funny.� I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.� (He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and wiggles it.)� Hi ya.

Monica: You might want to keep practicing.

Chandler: Yah.

(Chandler's cell phone rings.� He looks at it.)

Chandler: It's Joey.� (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear too.)� Hey Joe.

Joey: Dude, come home!

Chandler: What? Why?

Joey: Come . . .� Home.

Chandler: Look I, I can't.� What's going on?

Joey: I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin' on ya.� I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.

(Chandler and Monica look at each other.� Chandler nods.)

Joey: All right look.� (He walks to the hallway.)� If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna.

Chandler: No!

Joey: (outside the apartment door) I just heard him!

Chandler: (softly) Can you . . . hear him . . . now?

Joey: (listens at the door.)� No.� (pause) All right, I'm going in.

Chandler: No! Wait!

Joey: I heard him again!

Chandler: (writhes as if in agony) All right, look.� Just stay there.� I'm coming home.

Joey: Okay.� Great.� I'll see you when you get here.� I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.

Chandler: Is that really necessary?

Joey: Absolutely.� You'd do it for me.� Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Mike is blowing a note from his beer bottle.� Ross stares off to the side.)

Ross: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?� I mean, they said thirty minutes or less.� Well, how long has it been?

Mike: (looking at his watch) Eleven minutes.� (long pause)� And now twelve.� So, do you like the beer?

Ross: I do.� I do.� Although, it's actually a lager.

Mike: huh.� (pause)� What's the difference between beer and lager?

Ross: I don't know.� We could look it up.

Mike: (nods) Things are about to get wild.

[Scene: A bar.� Rachel and Phoebe are bringing their drinks from the bar to a sofa.]

Phoebe: Oh God.� Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?

Rachel: Oh God.� It seems like forever ago.

Phoebe: I know.� (sighs)�� So, what's going on with you and Ross?

Rachel: Well, um . . . I don't know.� I mean, for a long time nothing.� But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.

Phoebe: Oh my God!� I love things.� What happened?

Rachel: Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.� And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.

Phoebe: Eye-contact?

Rachel: Mm-hmm.

Phoebe: I hope you were using protection.

Waiter: (with tray and two drinks)� Excuse me.� Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

Rachel: Oh.� (to Phoebe) Should we send them something back?

Phoebe: Oooh.� Let's do.� Let's send them mashed potatoes.

Rachel: No!� Wait!� No, no.� Don't do that!� That's going to make them think they can come over here.

Phoebe: So?� What if they do?

Rachel: Well, we're not here to meet guys.� You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.

Phoebe: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.� We're just having fun.� You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.� Chandler is seated in the chair and Monica stands behind the sofa.]

Monica: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.

Chandler: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?� (Monica tips her head slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?")� I heard it.

Monica: I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.

Chandler: All right.� I've got a plan.� I'll go down the fire escape.

Monica: Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."

Chandler: Hear me out woman.� I'll go down the fire escape.� Then, I'll wait for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.

Monica: Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?� (pause)� I heard it.

(Chandler runs to the window, opens it, starts out, but returns, casually walking back to his chair.)

Chandler: I'm just going to wait for a little while.

Monica: Scary pigeon's back?

Chandler: It's huge.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Three pizza crusts, two bottle caps and the plastic tripod are left in the otherwise empty pizza box.� Mike is making hollow popping noises with his mouth.� He begins to speak, but stops and pops his lips a few more times and takes a drink.� Ross smiles as if he has thought of something to say, but then he stops and sinks back in a slump on the sofa.]

[Scene: The bar.� Two men are chatting with Rachel and Phoebe.]

Rachel: Oh my God.� I can't believe you live in that building.� My grandmother lives in that building.� Ida Green?� No sense of personal space?� Kind of smells like chicken?� Looks like a potato.

Bill: "Spuds" is your grandmother?

Rachel: That's my bubby!

Kevin: So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.� Um. . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.

Phoebe: Yeah. . . I'm sorry.� We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys.� I, I have a boyfriend.


Kevin: All right. It's no big deal.

Bill: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?

Rachel: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.� But um. . .

Bill: Then, can I have your number?

Rachel: (pause) I'm sorry, no.

Bill: Okay. (They start to walk away.)

Rachel: Oh sure.� (She pulls a business card from her purse and writes on it.)

Phoebe: (Reading the card.) Oh my God, you're giving your real number.

Bill: Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.

Rachel: Great.

Bill: Bye

Phoebe: Bye. (The guys leave.) Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?

Rachel: I don't know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.

Phoebe: What about Ross?� What about your moment?� Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?

Rachel: No.� No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.� "Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."

Rachel: (lowers voice to imitate Ross) "Yeah."� (Clears throat.)� "Me too."

Rachel: (as herself) "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."

Rachel: (as Ross) "Yeah."� (Clears throat twice.) "Me neither." (Clears throat again.)

Rachel: (as herself) "Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"

Rachel: (as Ross) "Yeah.� That works for me." (Clears throat twice more.)

Phoebe: Yeah, I see what you mean.� By the way, nice Ross imitation.

Rachel: Oh, thanks.

Phoebe: But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

Rachel: (whining) Wha. . . hey!

Phoebe: (pointing) Better!

Rachel: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know?� I should just . . . move on with my life.

Phoebe: Really?� You're moving on from Ross?

Rachel: I don't know.� Do I have to decide right now?

Phoebe: Well, you kind of just did.� That guy is going to call you tonight.� Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.

Rachel: Oh God, Ross.� Ross is going to pick up the phone.� Oh, I have to get my number back.� (She turns to find Bill, but they have gone.)� Oh my God.� He's gone.

Phoebe: (imitating Rachel) "Oh, I have to get my number back.� Oh my God.� He's gone."� (smiles) Dead on.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Ross and Mike are sitting on the sofa.� Ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while Mike blows his cheeks out.� Ross blows a piece of fuzz from his finger.)

Mike: (releases a whoosh of air) Ya know, I'm going to take off.

Ross: So soon?

Mike: Well, yeah.

Ross: Okay.� Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.

Mike: Ah, you mean lager.

Ross: Ah yeah.� Good times.

(Mike leaves.� Ross closes the door behind him.)

Mike: (In the hall, relieved) Oh.

(Ross, inside the door, releases a sign of relief.� Back in the hall, Mike's cell phone rings.)

Mike: Hello?

Phoebe: (calling from the bar on her cell phone.) Hey, Mike, it's me.� Listen, is um, is Ross near you?

Mike: Uh, no.� I just left.

Phoebe: Well, you have to go back in.

Mike: Wha . . .?� Go back?� To the "land where time stands still"?

Phoebe: I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.� So, you have to intercept all his calls.

Mike: I can't do that!

Phoebe: (to Rachel) He says he can't do that.

Rachel: Oh give me , , ,� (Phoebe gives Rachel the phone.)� Hi, Mike?� Hi.� Listen.� I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?� If you do this I . . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.� Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.

Phoebe: All right. (She takes the phone from Rachel.)� Hello?� Hi.� I'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

Mike: All right.� I'll do it.� (Phoebe gives the thumbs-up sign to Rachel.)� But really, how much dirtier can it get?

Phoebe: (knowingly chuckles) Oh, Mike.� Bye.

(Mike knocks on Ross's door.� Ross opens it.)

Mike: Hey buddy.

Ross: Uh, hi.

Mike: Um, can I come back in?

Ross: (putting his arm up with his hand on the door frame.)� Why?� (He starts to lower his arm.)

Mike: (Entering the apartment) I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.

Ross: (whining) But you left.

[Scene: The hallway and stairs outside Chandler and Monica's apartment.� Chandler enters from the stairs.� Joey is sitting with a baseball bat.]

Joey: Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.

Chandler: (pause) Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.

(Joey thinks a moment. Then, he nods.� Joey follows Chandler into the apartment.)

Monica: (gasp) Chandler!� You're home!

Chandler: That's right.� You're husband's home.� So, now the sex can stop.

(Joey gives him and odd look.� Monica gives a similar look.)

Monica: What are you saying?

Chandler: Joey said that you're in here with another man.

Monica: There's no man in here.� How dare you accuse me of that.� (She slaps Chandler.)

Joey: All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?� (He checks the bathroom shaking the bat.� Then he proceeds to their bedroom.)� Bwa-ah-ah!

(Thudding sounds can be heard from the bedroom.)

Chandler: (To Monica) What is he doing?

Monica: (smiling) I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.

Joey: (emerging) Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.

Chandler: All right.� Well, I'll check the guest room.

Joey: (sniffing the air and then Monica.)� Why do I smell men's cologne?

Monica: (sniffing Joey) I think that's you.

Joey: (sniffs his shirt.)� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.

Chandler: There's nobody here Joe.

Joey: I guess not.

Monica: I can't believe you thought I was cheating.� (pointing at Joey) You own me an apology.

Joey: Yeah, right Monica.� I'm so sorry.

Monica: (suddenly starts issuing him out) Ah, it's an honest mistake.� It could happen to anyone.� All right, see ya.

Joey: (spots the suitcase just inside the door where Chandler left it) Whoa, whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?

Chandler: (thinks, then turns to Monica) I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Mike is reading from a book.]

Mike: So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing.� Fascinating isn't it.

Ross: Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

(Phone rings.)

Mike: I'll get it.� (He lunges across Ross's lap on the sofa to reach the phone.� Ross stares at him with wide eyes.)� Hello?� Ross's place.� Mike speaking.� (pause.� Hands phone to Ross)� It's for you.

Ross: (takes the phone, but speaks to Mike) I don't understand what just happened here.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment " continuing action.]

Joey: What's going on?

Chandler: I'm sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .� I didn't think you'd understand.

Joey: What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think I'm like, "Duh."� (He strikes himself in the head with the bat.� He stands dazed for a moment.)

Monica: Joey?

Joey: Yeah?� (His eyes bug out.)

Monica: I don't know what to say.� We shouldn't have lied to you.

Chandler: Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

Joey: (pause) Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.

Chandler: I'm sorry. �That's the one thing I can't do.� I promised I'd be with Monica.

Joey: All right.

Monica: (taps chandler on the arm) You can go.

Chandler: What?

Monica: You should go to the game.� It's okay.� I want you to.

Chandler: Really?� You're gonna be okay?

Monica: Yeah, I'll be fine.� You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.

Chandler: You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?

Monica: It's gonna be so hot!� (She kisses him.)

Chandler: Okay, bye.

Monica: Have fun.

Joey: Thanks.� (Joey and Chandler exit to the hall.� Joey pulls out the tickets and hands one to Chandler.)� Here's your ticket.

Chandler: Hey, listen.� I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.

Joey: Thanks man.

(Chandler heads toward the stairs, but makes a turn back to his apartment while looking at the ticket.)
